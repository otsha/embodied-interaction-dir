# Final Project Proposal

With the final project, I would like to explore augmented reality development as I am currently planning to work on something AR-related for my master's thesis.

**Ideas & themes:** Physical interaction, generative art, potential invasiveness & obstructiveness of AR content if used in a certain way

## "Rikkaruohoja" / "Weeds" (working title)

The viewer is presented with a whiteboard and a marker. They can draw or write anything they would like. However, virtual flowers / vines / other abstract shapes start appearing on top of their drawings, obstructing (at least partially) the pictures and messages if they are wearing an AR headset. Think invasive species: lupine / kudzu / ipomoea - plants that grow quickly, suffocate other plants and trees and are difficult to get rid of.

I think there is potential for an interesting contrast between a seemingly fun physical interaction with AR (drawing and generating patterns) and the question of censorship with AR technologies. Who gets a say in what is censored or not? The so-called "metaverse" platforms, of course.

While admittedly the idea is not particularly original, it presents an interesting way for me to explore the technologies (and possibly the themes) I (think) I will work with during my thesis.

Below are two concept images that will probably end up making the final product really underwhelming.

**Fig. 2** With the headset on, holographic weeds will appear on top of the drawings, obscuring what is underneath.

### Tools & Technologies

- Hololens 2
- Unreal Engine
- Blank canvas & painting tools (or just a whiteboard and a marker)

### Visual Inspiration
