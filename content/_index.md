# Final Project: Weeds

*An interactive AR/MR experience in which you can grow plants on the surfaces around you.*

The viewer can hover their hand over a surface to have random plants grow on it. The plants are a mix of native plants (violets, ferns, chamomile, lingonberries, lilies of the valley) and invasive plant species (lupine).
